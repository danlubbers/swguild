        <h1>Lateralus</h1>
        
        <h2>TOOL</h2>
        
        <h3>Release Date: May 15th, 2001</h3>
        
        <p>The title track, "Lateralus", incorporates the Fibonacci sequence. 
            The theme of the song describes the desire of humans to explore and to 
            expand for more knowledge and a deeper understanding of everything. The 
            lyrics "spiral out", refers to this desire and also to the Fibonacci spiral, 
            which is formed by creating and arranging squares for each number in the 
            sequence's 1,1,2,3,5,8,... pattern, and drawing a curve that connects to two 
            corners of each square. This would, allowed to continue onwards, theoretically 
            create a never-ending and infinitely-expanding spiral. Related to this, the 
            song's main theme features successive time signatures 9/8, 8/8, and 7/8. 
            The number 987 is the sixteenth integer of the Fibonacci sequence.</p>
